## Data Storage

The application stores all data in CSV files in the `data/` directory:

- `receipts.csv`: All store receipts
- `receipt_items_*.csv`: Individual items for each receipt

## Key Concepts

### Expense Categories
- **Groepskas**: Group expenses paid by the scout account
- **POEF**: Fridge drinks and cigarettes, tracked separately and paid by leaders
- **PA**: Personal purchases requested by individual leaders

### POEF System
- Physical list tracking drinks and cigarettes taken from common fridge
- Each leader has a personal counter
- Drinks and cigarettes are priced individually per leader
- Final settlement at end of trip

### Data Validation
The application ensures data consistency by:
- Validating receipt totals match item totals
- Checking PA items are assigned to valid leaders
- Preventing orphaned data references
- Real-time validation and error feedback

## Technical Details

### Data Models
- **Leader**: Represents a scouting leader with financial tracking
- **Receipt**: Contains multiple expenses with category totals
- **Expense**: Individual expense items with categorization
- **ExpenseCategory**: Enum for Groepskas, POEF, and PA

### Services
- **DataService**: Handles data persistence and retrieval
- **FinanceService**: Provides business logic and calculations

### UI Patterns
- **MVC-like Architecture**: Separation of data, logic, and presentation
- **Observer Pattern**: Tabs update when data changes
- **Factory Pattern**: Reusable dialog creation
- **Command Pattern**: Action buttons with confirmation

## Benefits of the New System

1. **Modularity**: Each tab is self-contained and focused
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features or tabs
4. **Reusability**: Common components shared across tabs
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive interface with clear workflows
6. **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation and error handling
7. **Efficiency**: Auto-save and real-time updates
8. **Visual Feedback**: Clear status indicators and progress feedback

## Tips for Best Use

1. **Regular Backups**: Use the backup function regularly
2. **Daily Validation**: Run data validation after each day's entries
3. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent item names for better tracking
4. **Export Summaries**: Export summaries regularly for safekeeping
5. **Use Auto-save**: No need to manually save - changes apply immediately
6. **Check Status**: Monitor the status bar for operation feedback

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Data not saving**: Check file permissions in the data directory
- **Import errors**: Ensure you're running Python 3.7+
- **GUI not displaying**: Verify tkinter is available (included with most Python installations)
- **Empty summaries**: Check if leaders have PA assignments or POEF counts

### Data Recovery
- Check the `data/backup_*` directories for automatic backups
- CSV files can be manually edited if needed
- Use the validation function to check data integrity
