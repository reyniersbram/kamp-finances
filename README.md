## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external dependencies required (uses only standard library)

### Setup
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Usage

### Getting Started

2. **Set POEF Prices**: Configure the price per drink for each leader
3. **Start Tracking**: Begin entering daily receipts and POEF entries

### Daily Workflow

## Data Storage

The application stores all data in JSON files in the `data/` directory:
- `leaders.json`: Leader information, expenses, and POEF drink counts
- `receipts.json`: All store receipts and items

## Key Concepts

### Expense Categories
- **Groepskas**: Group expenses paid by the scout account
- **POEF**: Fridge drinks, tracked separately and paid by leaders
- **PA**: Personal purchases requested by individual leaders

### POEF System
- Physical list tracking drinks taken from common fridge
- Each leader has a personal counter
- Drinks are priced individually per leader
- Final settlement at end of trip

### Data Validation
The application ensures data consistency by:
- Validating receipt totals match item totals
- Checking PA items are assigned to valid leaders
- Preventing orphaned data references

## Tips for Best Use

1. **Regular Backups**: Use the backup function regularly
2. **Daily Validation**: Run data validation after each day's entries
3. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent item names for better tracking
4. **Export Summaries**: Export summaries regularly for safekeeping

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Data not saving**: Check file permissions in the data directory
- **Import errors**: Ensure you're running Python 3.7+
- **GUI not displaying**: Verify tkinter is available (included with most Python installations)

### Data Recovery
- Check the `data/backup_*` directories for automatic backups
- JSON files can be manually edited if needed
- Use the validation function to check data integrity
